        <p>A super moist banana bread which uses six bananas!</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup margarine, softened</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>6 very ripe bananas, mashed </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.</li>

            <li>In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and margarine until light and fluffy. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition, then stir in the vanilla.</li>


            <li>In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking soda and salt. Blend this mixture into the egg mixture, alternately with the buttermilk; stir just to combine. Fold in the mashed bananas; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour batter into prepared pan.</li>


            <li>Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes our clean, about 60 minutes.</li>
